Just a quick thing I am throwing together

Initial use case:
Daily shopping visits for clothing, items, collectibles, wallpaper and flooring from Nook's Cranny, the Able Sister's, Kick's stall, and Redd's boat.
Not including Leif (only sells plants) or Saharah (purchases are random)

Desired user behavior outcome:
Go to shop and enter what is available
Checks records for that player to see if catalogued already, and what variants are catalogued
Returns shopping list displaying all variants not yet purchased (using images once possible), if any
As user purchases items, checking off grays out image
User is then asked to confirm shopping trip is complete
User catalogue is updated for tomorrow

Potential future behavior:
Friending others (or allowing public access) means others can see what visitors you have and the items in the stores, as well as what from their catalogue they can buy
